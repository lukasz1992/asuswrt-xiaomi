    tg3: Fix UDP fragments treated as RMCP

    The 5762 devices sometimes incorrectly treat udp fragments as RMCP
    packets and route to the APE. This patch sets the RX_MODE_IPV4_FRAG_FIX
    bit for these devices which enables the proper behaviour.

    tg3: Enable support for timesync gpio output

    The PTP_CAPABLE tg3 devices have a gpio output that is toggled when the
    free running counter matches a watchdog value. This patch adds support
    to set the watchdog and enable this feature.

    Since the output is controlled via bits in the EAV_REF_CLCK_CTL
    register, we have to read-modify-write it when we stop/resume.

    tg3: Allow NVRAM programming when interface is down

    Previously, when the interface was brought down, the driver would set
    the power state to D3hot. In D3hot, we don't have access to the NVRAM.
    This patch removes the call to set the power state to PCI_D3hot in
    close. A following patch will implement the shutdown handler to properly
    set the D3hot state when the system is going down.

    Doing the above means that the TG3_PHYFLG_IS_LOW_POWER should not be
    checked to validate access to the NVRAM.

    tg3: Remove incorrect switch to aux power

    During probe, the driver is incorrectly switching the power to Vaux on
    the 5717 and later devices. At this point, we are in D0 state and
    drawing maximum power. We also definitely have Vmain available. It
    doesn't make sense to switch to Vaux since it has a lesser maximum power
    draw and we might go over the limit. On a new system, we observe that
    not all ports are recognized in some of the slots with this call in
    place.

    net/tg3: Avoid delay during MMIO access

    When the EEH error is the result of a fenced host bridge, MMIO accesses
    can be very slow (milliseconds) to timeout and return all 1's,
    thus causing the driver various timeout loops to take way too long and
    trigger soft-lockup warnings (in addition to taking minutes to recover).

    It might be worthwhile to check if for any of these cases, ffffffff is
    a valid possible value, and if not, bail early since that means the HW
    is either gone or isolated. In the meantime, checking that the PCI channel
    is offline would be workaround of the problem.

    tg3: Prevent system hang during repeated EEH errors.

    The current tg3 code assumes the pci_error_handlers to be always called
    in sequence.  In particular, during ->error_detected(), NAPI is disabled
    and the device is shutdown.  The device is later reset and NAPI
    re-enabled in ->slot_reset() and ->resume().

    In EEH, if more than 6 errors are detected in a hour, only
    ->error_detected() will be called.  This will leave the driver in an
    inconsistent state as NAPI is disabled but netif_running state is still
    true.  When the device is later closed, we'll try to disable NAPI again
    and it will loop forever.

    We fix this by closing the device if we encounter any error conditions
    during the normal sequence of the pci_error_handlers.

        feedback.

    tg3: Wait for boot code to finish after power on

    Some systems that don't need wake-on-lan may choose to power down the
    chip on system standby. Upon resume, the power on causes the boot code
    to startup and initialize the hardware. On one new platform, this is
    causing the device to go into a bad state due to a race between the
    driver and boot code, once every several hundred resumes. The same race
    exists on open since we come up from a power on.

    This patch adds a wait for boot code signature at the beginning of
    tg3_init_hw() which is common to both cases. If there has not been a
    power-off or the boot code has already completed, the signature will be
    present and poll_fw() returns immediately. Also return immediately if
    the device does not have firmware.

    tg3: Ensure boot code has completed initialization before accessing hardware

    After resetting the device, the driver waits for a signature to be
    updated to know that firmware has completed initialization. However, the
    call to tg3_poll_fw() is being done too late and we're writing to the
    GRC_MODE register before it has completely initialized, causing
    contention with firmware.  This logic has existed since day one but is
    causing PCIE link to go down randomly at startup on one platform once
    every few hundred reboots.

    Move the tg3_poll_fw() up to before we write to the GRC_MODE register
    after reset.

    uninterrupted on driver reload, reboot and interface up/down.

    The other pros of this feature are
     - It speeds up boot up time by several seconds as DHCP addresses can be
       acquired faster.
     - It avoids lengthy Spanning Tree delay.

    On powerup the hardware brings up the phy with default settings. If the
    link is not up, the management software configures the phy to gigabit
    and starts autonegotiate. Subsequently, as long as the link is up, the
    driver and management refrain from resetting and/or changing any
    configuration that the link depends on.

    The LNK_FLAP_AVOID setting is an NVRAM user configurable bit and is
    disabled by default.  If this setting is enabled, we skip powering down
    the phy and resetting it.

    A second NVRAM setting is 1G_ON_VAUX_OK (off by default). This adds
    support for gigabit link speed when device is on auxiliary power.

    Commit 184b89044fb6e2a74611dafa69b1dce0d98612c6 ("tg3: Use VPD fw version

    overflow.

    Limit the hardware's reported firmware string length (max 255 bytes) to
    stay inside the driver's firmware string length (32 bytes). On overflow,
    truncate the formatted firmware string instead of potentially overwriting
    portions of the tg3 struct.

    tg3: 5715 does not link up when autoneg off

    Commit d13ba512cbba7de5d55d7a3b2aae7d83c8921457 ("tg3: Remove
    SPEED_UNKNOWN checks") cleaned up the autoneg advertisement by
    removing some dead code. One effect of this change was that the
    advertisement register would not be updated if autoneg is turned off.

    This exposed a bug on the 5715 device w.r.t linking. The 5715 defaults
    to advertise only 10Mb Full duplex. But with autoneg disabled, it needs
    the configured speed enabled in the advertisement register to link up.

    This patch adds the work around to advertise all speeds on the 5715 when
    autoneg is disabled.

    tg3: Update link_up flag for phylib devices

    Commit f4a46d1f46a8fece34edd2023e054072b02e110d introduced a bug where
    the ifconfig stats would remain 0 for phylib devices. This is due to
    tp->link_up flag never becoming true causing tg3_periodic_fetch_stats()
    to return.

    The link_up flag was being updated in tg3_test_and_report_link_chg()
    after setting up the phy. This function however, is not called for
    phylib devices since the driver does not do the phy setup.

    This patch moves the link_up flag update into the common
    tg3_link_report() function that gets called for phylib devices as well
    for non phylib devices when the link state changes.

    To avoid updating link_up twice, we replace tg3_carrier_...() calls that
    are followed by tg3_link_report(), with netif_carrier_...(). We can then
    remove the unused tg3_carrier_on() function.

    tg3: Use different macros for pci_chip_rev_id accesses

    Upper case macros for various chip attributes are slightly

    Convert:

    GET_ASIC_REV(tp->pci_chip_rev_id)       -> tg3_asic_rev(tp)

    Add:
    tg3_chip_rev_id(tp) for tp->pci_chip_rev_id so access styles
    are similar to tg3_asic_rev and tg3_chip_rev.

    These macros are not converted to static inline functions
    because gcc (tested with 4.7.2) is currently unable to
    optimize the object code it produces the same way and code

     - For the 57766 and non Ax versions of 57765, bootcode needs to setup
       the PCIE Fast Training Sequence (FTS) value to prevent transmit hangs.
       Unfortunately, it does not have enough room in the selfboot case (i.e.
       devices with no NVRAM).  The driver needs to implement this.

     - For performance reasons, the 2k DMA engine mode on the 57766 should
       be enabled and dma size limited to 2k for standard sized packets.

    tg3: Improve PCI function number detection.
    
    Simplify the code to detect PCI function number on 5717, 5719, and 5720.
    If shared memory does not have proper signature, read the function number
    from register directly.

    tg3: PTP - Implement the ptp api and ethtool functions
    
    This patch adds the ptp_caps structure, ptp api implementation,
    reference clock read and register/unregister functions.  All the basic
    clock operations as described in Documentation/ptp/ptp.txt are
    supported.
    
    Frequency adjustment is performed using hardware with a 24 bit
    accumulator and a programmable correction value. On each clk, the
    correction value gets added to the accumulator and when it overflows,
    the time counter is incremented/decremented and the accumulator reset.
    
    So conversion from ppb to correction value is
    	ppb * (1 << 24) / 1000000000
    
    [Re-organized to put the ptp_clock_info struct declaration in one patch,
     added ptp_clock_info.name, and added locking to tg3_ptp_adjtime() based
     on input from Richard Cochran.]

    tg3: Disable multiple TX rings by default due to hardware flaw
    
    Simple round-robin hardware TX scheduling can cause starvation of TX rings
    with small packets when other TX rings have large TSO or jumbo packets.
    
    In the simplest case, consider 2 TCP streams running in opposite
    directions.  The TSO TX traffic will hash to one ring and the ACKs for the
    incoming data on a different TCP connection will hash to a different TX
    ring.  The hardware fetches one complete TSO packet (up to 64K data)
    before servicing the other TX ring.  When it gets to the other TX ring, it
    will only fetch one packet (64-byte ACK packet in this case).  After that,
    it will switch back to the 1st ring filled with more TSO packets.  Because
    only one ACK can go out roughly every 500 usec in this case, the incoming
    data rate becomes very low.
    
    Update version to 3.125.

    The rx producer index fields for vector 0's status block should be
    considered reserved in this case.  This patch changes the code to
    respect these reserved fields, which avoids a kernel panic when these
    fields take on non-zero values.

    tg3: Fix RSS ring refill race condition
    
    The RSS feature in tg3 hardware has only one rx producer ring for all
    RSS rings.  NAPI vector 1 is special and handles the refilling of the
    rx producer ring on behalf of all RSS rings.  There is a race condition
    between these RSS NAPIs and the NAPI[1].  If NAPI[1] finishes checking
    for refill and then another RSS ring empties the rx producer ring
    before NAPI[1] exits NAPI, the chip will be completely out of SKBs in
    the rx producer ring.
    
    We fix this by adding a flag tp->rx_refill and rely on napi_schedule()/
    napi_complete() to help synchronize it to close the race condition.
    
    Update driver version to 3.123.

    tg3: Fix tg3_get_stats64 for 5700 / 5701 devs
    
    tg3_get_stats64() takes tp->lock when dealing with non-serdes bcm5700
    and bcm5701 devices.  However, functions that call tg3_halt() have
    already acquired tp->lock.  When tg3_get_stats64() is called in
    tg3_halt(), deadlock will occur.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by separating the stat gathering code into
    a new tg3_get_nstats() function.  tg3_get_stats64() is recoded to call
    this function and take tp->lock.  The code that takes tp->lock in
    tg3_calc_crc_errors() has been removed.  Function signatures have been
    cleaned up too.

    tg3: Clear RECOVERY_PENDING with reset_task_cancel

    If an error happens in the tx completion thread, tg3_reset_task will be
    scheduled and TX_RECOVERY_PENDING will be set.  The TX_RECOVERY_PENDING
    flag causes tg3_poll[_msix] to return early before doing much of its
    work.  Tg3_reset_task() gets canceled when the configuration of the
    device is changing, which always results in a chip reset.  When this
    happens, the TX_RECOVERY_PENDING flag may be left set, which would
    unnecessarily hinder tg3_poll from doing work.  This patch fixes the

    tg3: Fix single-vector MSI-X code

    Kdump kernels leave MSI-X interrupts (as setup by the crashed kernel)
    enabled.  However, kdump only enables one CPU in the new environment,
    thus causing tg3 to abort MSI-X setup.  When the driver attempts to
    enable INTA or MSI interrupt modes on a kdump kernel, interrupt
    delivery fails.

    This patch attempts to workaround the problem by forcing the driver
    to enable a single MSI-X interrupt.  In such a configuration, the
    device's multivector interrupt mode must be disabled.

    tg3: Scale back code that modifies MRRS
    
    Tg3 normally gets a performance boost by increasing the PCI Maximum Read
    Request Size (MRRS) to 4k.  Unfortunately, this is causing some problems
    on particular hardware platforms.  This patch removes all code that
    modifies the MRRS except for one case.
    
    As part of a solution to fix an internal FIFO problem on the 5719, the
    driver artificially capped the MRRS to 2k for the entire 5719, and later
    5720, ASIC revs.  This was overly aggressive and only really needed to

    tg3: Fix TSO CAP for 5704 devs w / ASF enabled
    
    On the earliest TSO capable devices, TSO was accomplished through
    firmware.  The TSO cannot coexist with ASF management firmware though.
    The tg3 driver determines whether or not ASF is enabled by calling
    tg3_get_eeprom_hw_cfg(), which checks a particular bit of NIC memory.
    Commit dabc5c670d3f86d15ee4f42ab38ec5bd2682487d, entitled "tg3: Move
    TSO_CAPABLE assignment", accidentally moved the code that determines
    TSO capabilities earlier than the call to tg3_get_eeprom_hw_cfg().  As a
    consequence, the driver was attempting to determine TSO capabilities
    before it had all the data it needed to make the decision.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by revisiting and reevaluating the decision
    after tg3_get_eeprom_hw_cfg() is called.

    tg3: Fix advertisement handling
    
    Commit 28011cf19b (net: Add ethtool to mii advertisment conversion
    helpers) added a helper function ethtool_adv_to_mii_100bt() and
    tg3_copper_is_advertising_all(), tg3_phy_autoneg_cfg() were
    modified to use this.
    Before that commit, ethtool to mii advertisement conversion was
    done wrt speed, but now pause operation is also taken account.
    So, in tg3_copper_is_advertising_all(), below condition becomes
    true and this makes link up fails.
    
    	if ((adv_reg & ADVERTISE_ALL) != all_mask)
    		return 0;
    
    To fix this add ADVERTISE_ALL bit and operation to cap speed,
    and change default advertisement not including ADVERTISED_Pause.

    tg3: switch to build_skb() infrastructure
    
    This is very similar to bnx2x conversion, but simpler since no special
    alignement is required, so goal was not to reduce skb truesize.
    
    Using build_skb() reduces cache line misses in the driver, since we
    use cache hot skb instead of cold ones. Number of in-flight sk_buff
    structures is lower, they are more likely recycled in SLUB caches
    while still hot.

    tg3: Eliminate timer race with reset_task
    
    During shutdown, it is impossible to reliably disable the timer and
    reset_task threads.  Each thread can schedule the other, which leads to
    shutdown code that chases its tail.
    
    To fix the problem, this patch removes the ability of tg3_reset_task to
    schedule a new timer thread.  To support this change, tg3_timer no
    longer terminates itself, but rather goes into a polling mode.

    tg3: Schedule at most one tg3_reset_task run
    
    It is possible for multiple threads in the tg3 driver to each attempt to
    schedule a run of tg3_reset_task().  The multiple tg3_reset_task
    executions could all wind up on the same queue (and execute serially) or
    wind up on the queues of another processor (which could execute in
    parallel).  Either scenario is not what was truly desired.
    
    This patch adds a new flag, TG3_FLAG_RESET_TASK_PENDING, and uses it to
    determine whether or not to schedule another run of tg3_reset_task().
    With the new flag comes two new functions to facilitate scheduling and
    descheduling of tg3_reset_task().

    tg3: Determine PCI function number in one place
    
    tg3 devices will need to know exactly what function number they are so
    that they can communicate their status to the other functions.  In a KVM
    environment, the function number of a device presented by the kernel
    might not be the true function number, so an alternative method to
    determine the function number is needed.
    
    This patch used to contain an implementation for the alternative method,
    but recently we discovered a hardware bug that renders it incorrect.
    While new method is not yet known, it is still useful to consolidate the
    code that determines the PCI function to one location and use the
    results throughout the code.

    tg3: Check transitions to D0 power state
    
    Currently pci_set_power_state() does not return useful return codes for
    transitions to the D0 power state.  If a device refuses to go into D0,
    the PCI layer issues a warning but returns success.
    
    Entering into D0 is a requirement for correct operation of tg3 devices
    though.  If the PCI layer should be changed to return an error code for
    this type of failure, the tg3 driver would be interested in catching it
    and reacting to it.  This patch makes the necessary modifications.

    tg3: remove unnecessary read of PCI_CAP_ID_EXP
    
    The PCIE capability offset is saved during PCI bus walking.  Use the
    value from pci_dev instead of checking in the driver and saving it off
    the the driver specific structure.  It will remove an unnecessary search
    in the PCI configuration space if this value is referenced instead of
    reacquiring it.
    
    v2 of the patch re-adds the PCI_EXPRESS flag and adds comments
    describing why it is necessary.

    ethtool: cosmetic: Use ethtool ethtool_cmd_speed API
    
    This updates the network drivers so that they don't access the
    ethtool_cmd::speed field directly, but use ethtool_cmd_speed()
    instead.
    
    For most of the drivers, these changes are purely cosmetic and don't
    fix any problem, such as for those 1GbE/10GbE drivers that indirectly
    call their own ethtool get_settings()/mii_ethtool_gset(). The changes
    are meant to enforce code consistency and provide robustness with

    tg3: Only allow phy ioctls while netif_running
    
    When tg3 was new, phy accesses through ioctl were allowable at any time.
    Then, the driver started shutting down the phy when the device was
    closed.  Phy accesses would be allowed when the driver first attached to
    the device, but then would be forbidden after the device had been up'd
    and down'd.  After that, management firmware made it illegal to access
    the phy unless the driver "owned" the device.  Now that most firmware
    is being moved over to the APE, it is less clear when phy accesses are
    safe.
    
    While it is possible to attempt to identify these conditions and code
    the driver to navigate through the pitfalls, it could be perplexing to
    the admin why phy accesses work in some cases and not others.  This
    patch brings some uniformity to the problem by only allowing phy
    accesses while the driver has control of the device.

    tg3: Adjust rx prod ring bd replenish thresholds
    
    The oldest tg3 devices had large rx producer ring BD caches.  Back then,
    it made sense to make the BD cache replenish threshold only a function
    of the number of rx buffers posted by the driver.  Since then, the BD
    cache sizes have shrunk to 25% of their original size and, in some
    cases, the ring sizes have quadrupled in size.  Under such conditions,
    static BD cache replenish thresholds no longer match the hardware
    constraints.
    
    This patch attempts to factor in the BD cache size into the bd cache
    replenish strategy, taking the existing hardware bugs into account.

    ethtool: allow custom interval for physical identification
    
    When physical identification of an adapter is done by toggling the
    mechanism on and off through software utilizing the set_phys_id operation,
    it is done with a fixed duration for both on and off states.  Some drivers
    may want to set a custom duration for the on/off intervals.  This patch
    changes the API so the return code from the driver's entry point when it
    is called with ETHTOOL_ID_ACTIVE can specify the frequency at which to
    cycle the on/off states, and updates the drivers that have already been
    converted to use the new set_phys_id and use the synchronous method for
    identifying an adapter.
    
    The physical identification frequency set in the updated drivers is based
    on how it was done prior to the introduction of set_phys_id.
    
    Compile tested only.  Also fixes a compiler warning in sfc.
    
    v2: drivers do not return -EINVAL for ETHOOL_ID_ACTIVE
    v3: fold patchset into single patch and cleanup per Ben's feedback

    drivers/net: Remove IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM flag from network drivers
    
    The IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM flag is marked as deprecated and will be removed.
    
    Every input point to the kernel's entropy pool have to better document the
    type of entropy source it is.
    
    drivers/char/random.c now implements a set of interfaces that can be used for
    devices to collect enviromental noise. IRQF_SAMPLE_RANDOM will be replaced
    with these add_*_randomness exported functions.
    
    Network drivers are not a good source of entropy. They use as a source of
    entropy essentially a remote host. Which means that the source of entropy can
    be potentially controlled by an attacker. Also, with heavy workloads the
    entropy decreases due to less hardware interrupts happening thanks to irq
    mitigation and NAPI.
    
    If a system relies in its network interface as a entropy source it has a false
    sense of security. Systems that don't have devices whose drivers are good
    sources of entropy, should either use a hardware random number generator or
    feed the kernel's entropy pool from userspace using other sources of entropy
    such as EGD, video_entropyd, timer_entropyd and audio-entropyd.

    The tg3 driver uses the legacy PCI power management, so it has to do
    some PCI-specific things in its ->suspend() and ->resume() callbacks,
    which isn't necessary and should better be done by the PCI
    sybsystem-level power management code.

    device handling during system power transitions.

    drivers/net: don't use flush_scheduled_work()
    
    flush_scheduled_work() is on its way out.  This patch contains simple
    conversions to replace flush_scheduled_work() usage with direct
    cancels and flushes.
    
    Directly cancel the used works on driver detach and flush them in
    other cases.
    
    The conversions are mostly straight forward and the only dangers are,
    
    * Forgetting to cancel/flush one or more used works.
    
    * Cancelling when a work should be flushed (ie. the work must be
      executed once scheduled whether the driver is detaching or not).
    
    I've gone over the changes multiple times but it would be much
    appreciated if you can review with the above points in mind.

    tg3: Minor EEE code tweaks
    
    The first hunk of this patch makes sure that the driver checks for the
    appropriate preconditions before checking if EEE negotiation succeeded.
    More specifically the link needs to be full duplex for EEE to be
    enabled.
    
    The second and third hunks of this patch fix a bug where the eee
    advertisement register would be programmed with extra bits set.
    
    The fourth hunk of this patch makes sure the EEE capability flag is not
    set for 5718 A0 devices and that the device is not a serdes device.
    
    None of these modifications are strictly necessary.  The driver /
    hardware still does the right thing.  They are submitted primarily for
    correctness.

    vlan: Don't check for vlan group before vlan_tx_tag_present.
    
    Many (but not all) drivers check to see whether there is a vlan
    group configured before using a tag stored in the skb.  There's
    not much point in this check since it just throws away data that
    should only be present in the expected circumstances.  However,
    it will soon be legal and expected to get a vlan tag when no
    vlan group is configured, so remove this check from all drivers
    to avoid dropping the tags.

    and DUPLEX_INVALID for these fields.  This patch makes the presentation
    consistent by returning SPEED_INVALID and DUPLEX_INVALID when the device
    has not been brought up as well.

    tg3: Prepare for larger rx ring sizes
    
    This patch adds two new variables to track the size of the standard and
    jumbo rx producer ring sizes.  The code is then pivoted to these
    variables from preprocessor constants.

    tg3: Fix potential netpoll crash
    
    Up until now the tg3 driver would call netif_napi_add() for the maximum
    number of NAPI instances the driver could use.  The problem is that
    netpoll could call tg3_poll() on instances that are not active.  The net
    effect is that the driver will crash attempting to dereference
    uninitialized pointers.
    
    The fix is to only allocate as many NAPI instances as the driver would
    use in tg3_open() and deleted them in tg3_close().

    tg3: Fix read DMA FIFO overruns on recent devices
    
    Earlier versions of tg3 devices had a problem where the read DMA FIFO
    could be overrun in certain edge conditions.  The fix was to limit the
    number of rx BDs the hardware would fetch at a time.  For later devices
    (5761, 5784 and later ASIC revs), there is a hardware fix that must be
    enabled to fix the same problem.  This patch adds that hardware fix.
    
    There is a gap in the ASIC revision lineage where neither fix is
    applied.  This is intentional as these ASIC revisions are not afflicted
    by the bug.

    tg3: Improve small packet performance
    
    smp_mb() inside tg3_tx_avail() is used twice in the normal
    tg3_start_xmit() path (see illustration below).  The full memory
    barrier is only necessary during race conditions with tx completion.
    We can speed up the tx path by replacing smp_mb() in tg3_tx_avail()
    with a compiler barrier.  The compiler barrier is to force the
    compiler to fetch the tx_prod and tx_cons from memory.
    
    In the race condition between tg3_start_xmit() and tg3_tx(),
    we have the following situation:
    
    tg3_start_xmit()                       tg3_tx()
        if (!tg3_tx_avail())
            BUG();
    
        ...
    
        if (!tg3_tx_avail())
            netif_tx_stop_queue();         update_tx_index();
            smp_mb();                      smp_mb();
            if (tg3_tx_avail())            if (netif_tx_queue_stopped() &&
                netif_tx_wake_queue();         tg3_tx_avail())
    
    With smp_mb() removed from tg3_tx_avail(), we need to add smp_mb() to
    tg3_start_xmit() as shown above to properly order netif_tx_stop_queue()
    and tg3_tx_avail() to check the ring index.  If it is not strictly
    ordered, the tx queue can be stopped forever.
    
    This improves performance by about 3% with 2 ports running
    bi-directional 64-byte packets.

    tg3: Add 5784 ASIC rev to earlier PCIe MPS fix
    
    tg3 commit e7126997342560533317d8467e8516119ebcbd21 entitled
    "tg3: Preserve PCIe MPS setting for new devs" attempted to ensure the
    PCIe link negotiated Maximum Payload Size (MPS) setting was 128 bytes
    for all devices that didn't support higher speeds.  The 5784 device was
    mistakenly added to this list when it shouldn't have.  This patch
    removes the 5784 ASIC rev devices from that list.

    net: preserve ifreq parameter when calling generic phy_mii_ioctl().
    
    The phy_mii_ioctl() function unnecessarily throws away the original ifreq.
    We need access to the ifreq in order to support PHYs that can perform
    hardware time stamping.
    
    Two maverick drivers filter the ioctl commands passed to phy_mii_ioctl().
    This is unnecessary since phylib will check the command in any case.

    tg3: Re-inline VLAN tags when appropriate
    
    The tg3 driver is written so that VLAN tagged packets can be accepted,
    even if CONFIG_VLAN_8021Q or CONFIG_VLAN_8021Q_MODULE is not defined.
    (Think raw interfaces.)  If the device has ASF support enabled, the
    firmware requires the driver to enable VLAN tag stripping.  If VLAN
    tagging is not explicitly supported by the kernel and ASF is enabled,
    the driver will have to reinject the VLAN tag back into the packet
    stream.

    tg3: Optimize rx double copy test
    
    On a PCIX bus, the 5701 has a bug which requires the driver to double
    copy all rx packets.  The rx code uses the rx_offset device member as a
    flag to determine if this workaround should take effect.  The following
    patch will modify the rx_offset member such that this test will become
    less clear.
    
    The patch starts by integrating the workaround check into the packet
    length check.  It rounds out the implementation by relaxing the
    workaround restrictions if the platform has efficient unaligned
    accesses.

    The tg3_dump_state() function is commented out and doesn't get used much
    when debugging efforts are underway.  The chip architecture has also
    changed enough that any debugging effort that might use it would have to
    tailor it to the capabilities of the hardware.  This patch just removes
    the function entirely.

    tg3: Enforce DMA mapping / skb assignment ordering
    
    Michael Chan noted that there is nothing in the code that would prevent
    the compiler from delaying the access of the "mapping" member of the
    newly arrived packet until much later.  If this happened after the
    skb = NULL assignment, it is possible for the driver to pass a bad
    dma_addr value to pci_unmap_single().  To enforce this ordering, we need
    a write memory barrier.  The pairing read memory barrier already exists
    in tg3_rx_prodring_xfer() under the comments starting with
    "Ensure that updates to the...".

    tg3: Unwedge stuck MSI-X vectors
    
    The previous patch changed the code so that new rx buffer submissions to
    the hardware stall if a new submission would overwrite data needed by an
    unserviced rx packet.  On very busy 5717 and 57765 asic rev devices,
    there is a corner case where the hardware will fail to assert an MSI-X
    interrupt for rx traffic.  If that vector's interrupt never has another
    reason to assert, any rx buffers held will never be serviced.  If the
    buffers are never serviced and the hardware consumes all the available
    rx packets for other rx rings, deadlock will result.
    
    The most reliable and least intrusive way to work around the problem is
    to detect the case where new submissions would overwrite existing data
    and force all rx interrupt vectors to fire.

    tg3: Fix std rx prod ring handling
    
    There are some tg3 devices that require the driver to post new rx
    buffers in smaller increments.  Commit
    4361935afe3abc3e5a93006b99197fac1fabbd50, "tg3: Consider
    rx_std_prod_idx a hw mailbox" changed how the driver tracks the rx
    producer ring updates, but it does not make any special considerations
    for the above-mentioned devices.  For those devices, it is possible for
    the driver to hit the special case path, which updates the hardware
    mailbox register but skips updating the shadow software mailbox member.
    If the special case path represents the final mailbox update for this
    ISR iteration, the hardware and software mailbox values will be out of
    sync.  Ultimately, this will cause the driver to use a stale mailbox
    value on the next iteration, which will appear to the hardware as a
    large rx buffer update.  Bad things ensue.
    
    The fix is to update the software shadow mailbox member when the special
    case path is taken.

    tg3: Use pci_read_vpd() instead of private method
    
    If the driver needs to use PCI configuration space to read the VPD data,
    the accesses could collide with the pci_read_vpd() function.  This patch
    converts the driver to use pci_read_vpd() to avoid any potential

    tg3 / broadcom: Add code to disable rxc refclk
    
    The 5785 does not use the RXC reference clock.  Turning it off is
    desirable as it saves power.
    
    By default, the 50610 enables the RXC reference clock and the 50610M
    disables it.  Presumably this is one of the reasons why the hardware
    architect chose one over the other.
    
    Adding a "rx reference clock disable" flag is not the ideal way to
    describe the option, as it would force the MAC using a 50610M to set
    the flag.  Ideally we want the flags to represent opt-in behavior that
    deviates from hardware defaults.  Furthermore, the lack of a
    "disable" flag implies that the requester wants the rx reference clock
    enabled, which doesn't necessarily follow.
    
    By presenting the option as a passive statement (rx reference clock
    unused) rather than a command, I hope to convey an opt-in option to
    disable the rx reference clock that falls back to hardware defaults if
    not set.  A secondary benefit of this is that it keeps the
    intelligence about phy defaults in the broadcom module where it belongs
    and allows the broadcom module more latitude should a bug arise.

    The default value of the remaining bits in this register are zero.
    Rather than unnecessarily burn an extra bit in the dev_flags member in
    an attempt to enumerate all possible combinations, this patch take a
    more course grained approach and labels the option as "clear all bits".

    just a little too close to the expected performance based on timings.

    tg3: Move per-int rx members to per-int struct
    
    This patch moves the rx_rcb, rx_rcb_mapping, and rx_rcb_ptr return ring
    device members to a per-interrupt structure.  It also adds a new return
    ring consumer mailbox register member (consmbox) and converts the code
    to use it rather than a preprocessor constant.

    skb_dma_unmap() is quite expensive for small packets,

    One to access nr_frags, one to access dma_maps[0]
    
    Instead of dma_maps being an array of MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1 elements,
    let dma_head alone in a new dma_head field, close to nr_frags,
    to reduce cache lines misses.

    tg3: Allow screaming interrupt detection
    
    The tg3 driver's ISR is coded to accept interrupts as its own if the
    status block tag does not equal the last tag the driver has seen.  The
    last_tag field is updated from tg3_poll.  In a screaming interrupt
    situation from another device sharing tg3's IRQ, tg3_poll does not get
    a chance to be called, so the last_tag will always be out of sync with
    the status block tag.  Consequently, the driver will continually
    declare the screaming interrupts as its own, thus thwarting the
    screaming interrupt detection logic.
    
    This patch solves the problem by creating a new last_irq_tag member and
    recording the status block tag in the ISR.  The ISR then checks the
    last_irq_tag for interrupt ownership.
    
    Many thanks to John Marvin for the detailed bug report and analysis and
    Michael Chan for the bugfix.

    tg3: fix big endian MAC address collection failure
    
    We noticed on parisc that our broadcoms all swapped MAC addresses going
    from 2.6.29 to 2.6.30-rc1:
    
    Apr 11 07:48:24 ion kernel: eth0: Tigon3 [partno(BCM95700A6) rev 0105] (PCI:66MHz:64-bit) MAC address 00:30:6e:4b:15:59
    Apr 13 07:34:34 ion kernel: eth0: Tigon3 [partno(BCM95700A6) rev 0105] (PCI:66MHz:64-bit) MAC address 00:00:59:15:4b:6e
    
    The problem patch is:
    
    commit 6d348f2c1e0bb1cf7a494b51fc921095ead3f6ae
    Author: Matt Carlson <mcarlson@broadcom.com>
    Date:   Wed Feb 25 14:25:52 2009 +0000
    
        tg3: Eliminate tg3_nvram_read_swab()
    
    With the root cause being the use of memcpy to set the mac address:
    
       memcpy(&dev->dev_addr[0], ((char *)&hi) + 2, 2);
       memcpy(&dev->dev_addr[2], (char *)&lo, sizeof(lo));
    
    This might work on little endian machines, but it can't on big endian
    ones.  You have to use the original setting mechanism to be correct on
    all architectures.
    
    The attached patch fixes parisc.

    tg3: Eliminate tg3_nvram_read_swab()
    
    The remaining uses of tg3_nvram_read_swab() either intended to read the
    data from NVRAM exactly as tg3_nvram_read_be32() did or hide deeper
    interpretations of the data.  For the former case, a direct replacement
    of tg3_nvram_read_swab() with tg3_nvram_read_be32() is in order.  For
    the latter case, we remove tg3_nvram_read_swab() and document what the
    code is really doing.

    tg3: Correct NVRAM stream endian notations
    
    Any software requesting NVRAM data as it exists on NVRAM is necessarily
    requesting that the results be returned as a bytestream.  A bytestream
    data read in from the device can also be thought to be in big endian
    format.  Therefore, all the LE notations in the driver are mislabeled.
    This patch converts all LE notations to BE notations, carefully
    evaluating the surrounding code in the process.

    tg3: Invert nvram_read() and nvram_read_swab()
    
    This patch removes the blind byteswap of NVRAM data as it is read in.
    To preserve the logic at the call sites, this patch also inverts every
    call to tg3_nvram_read() and tg3_nvram_read_swab().  The call swap gets
    confusing within tg3_nvram_read_le() (LE is a misnomer), but the reader
    should be able to convince himself / herself that the resulting behavior
    is still unchanged.

    other packets larger than the desired MTU size.  This patch checks for
    and discards packets that are larger than the requested MTU but are not

    Commit 6833c043f9fc03696fde623914c4a0277df2a0bc introduced the phy
    auto-powerdown capability.  While the APD feature only works for 5761
    and 5784 asic revisions, the (harmless portion of the) code was applied
    to all 5705 and newer devices.  However, the 5906 phy departs from the
    usual design.  This commit was interfering with the 5906's ability to
    negotiate link against some switches.  This patch corrects the problem.

    tg3: Fix firmware loading
    
    This patch modifies how the tg3 driver handles device firmware.
    
    The patch starts by consolidating David Woodhouse's earlier patch under
    the same name.  Specifically, the patch moves the request_firmware call
    into a separate tg3_request_firmware() function and calls that function
    from tg3_open() rather than tg3_init_one().
    
    The patch then goes on to limit the number of devices that will make
    request_firmware calls.  The original firmware patch unnecessarily
    requested TSO firmware for devices that did not need it.  This patch
    reduces the set of devices making TSO firmware patches to approximately
    the following device set : 5703, 5704, and 5705.
    
    Finally, the patch reduces the effects of a request_firmware() failure.
    For those devices that are requesting TSO firmware, the driver will turn
    off the TSO capability.  If TSO firmware becomes available at a later
    time, the device can be closed and then opened again to reacquire the
    TSO capability.

    tg3: tg3.h cleanups
    
    This patch cleans up the tg3 header file by removing the preprocessor
    definitions for standard PCI configuration space registers.  The driver
    should be using the standard definitions when needed.  The patch
    continues by removing redundant PHY related definitions and reorganizes
    some of the remaining entries.

    tg3: Remove unused cfgspc device members
    
    This patch removes the pci_bist and pci_hdr_type members from the
    device structure and removes the code that references them.  They are
    not really used.
    
    The patch rounds out the changes by moving the pci_cmd member to plug
    a structure hole that would have been created.  On 32-bit systems, this
    movement removes a subsequent structure hole later in the structure. On
    64-bit systems though, the movement merely consolidates two holes into
    one larger hole.

    tg3: WOL fixes
    
    The first hunk of this patch inverts a flag that was accidentally
    toggled as part of commit 0a459aac9d151c2e36ec65723b9b845b24c5cbc3
    ("tg3: Allow WOL for phylib controlled Broadcom phys").
    
    The second hunk of the patch removes the call to
    device_may_wakeup() in the 5906 config detection path.  At the
    point of the call, the driver shouldn't be querying for WOL
    capability.  It should be detecting and setting it.

    net: Refactor full duplex flow control resolution
    
    These 4 drivers have identical full duplex flow control resolution
    functions.  This patch changes them all to use one common function.
    
    The function in question decides whether a device should enable TX and
    RX flow control in a standard way (IEEE 802.3-2005 table 28B-3), so this
    should also be useful for other drivers.

    net: Move flow control definitions to mii.h
    
    flags used within drivers for indicating tx and rx flow control are
    defined in 4 drivers (and probably more), move these constants to mii.h.
    
    The 3 SMSC drivers use the same constants (FLOW_CTRL_TX), but TG3 uses
    TG3_FLOW_CTRL_TX, so this patch also renames the constants within TG3.

    tg3: Allow GPHY powerdown on 5761
    
    The ENABLE_APE flag tells the driver whether or not the device has an
    Application Processing Engine (APE).  The APE does not need the PHY to
    be powered unless it is running management firmware.  For backwards
    compatibility, management firmware will still set the ENABLE_ASF bit.
    Consequently, there is no reason to consider the ENABLE_APE flag when
    deciding whether or not to power down the phy.

    tg3: Use NET_IP_ALIGN
    
    This patch replaces hardcoded 2's with the NET_IP_ALIGN constant or
    TG3_RAW_IP_ALIGN where appropriate.  Some platforms can redefine the
    NET_IP_ALIGN definition to zero if unaligned DMA transfers cost more
    than the IP header alignment gains.  This patch represents a
    performance improvement when using the 5701 on these platforms.
    The copy path can be avoided.
    
    TG3_RAW_IP_ALIGN is used in cases where we always want to align the
    IP header on dword boundaries.

    tg3: Refine power management and WOL code
    
    Commit 12dac0756d357325b107fe6ec24921ec38661839 ("tg3: adapt tg3 to
    use reworked PCI PM code") introduced the new PCI PM API to the tg3
    driver.  The patch was understandably conservative, so this patch
    elaborates on that work.
    
    The patch starts by creating a single point in tg3_set_power_state()
    to decide whether or not to enable WOL.  The rest of the code in
    tg3_set_power_state() was then pivoted to use the result of this
    decision.
    
    The patch then makes sure the device is allowed to wakeup before
    reporting whether or not WOL is currently enabled.  The final hunks of
    the patch consolidate where the WOL capability and WOL enabled flags
    are set to a single location.

    tg3: Preserve DASH connectivity when WOL enabled
    
    DASH firmware runs on the APE side of the chip, but it requires a few MAC
    to be programmed correctly.
    
    When WOL is enabled and management firmware is disabled, incoming
    packets are evaluated and discarded at the chip's rule processor.
    When management firmware is enabled, the hardware must be informed that
    there are agents further up the stack that still use the incoming
    frames.  Normally management firmware will configure the MAC correctly
    on its own, but there can be cases where the setting could get clobbered
    by the driver.  The first hunk of this patch preserves this setting.
    
    The second hunk of this patch wipes out the driver present signature of
    the APE memory space.  By doing so, the DASH firmware can assume
    driver absent behavior.

    net: convert print_mac to %pM
    
    This converts pretty much everything to print_mac. There were
    a few things that had conflicts which I have just dropped for
    now, no harm done.
    
    I've built an allyesconfig with this and looked at the files
    that weren't built very carefully, but it's a huge patch.

    In preparation of giving mii_bus objects a device tree presence of
    their own, rename struct mii_bus's ->dev argument to ->parent, since
    having a 'struct device *dev' that points to our parent device
    conflicts with introducing a 'struct device dev' representing our own

    tg3: fix 64 bit counter for ethtool stats
    
    Ethtool stats are 64-bits in length.  net_device_stats members are
    unsigned long types.  When gathering information for
    a get_ethtool_stats call, the driver will call a driver-private,
    inlined get_stat64() function, which returns an unsigned long value.
    This call will inadvertently mask off the upper 32-bits of a stat on
    32-bit machines.
    
    This patch defines a new get_estat() inline function and modifies the
    ESTAT_ADD() macro to use it.

    tg3: Fix firmware event timeouts
    
    The git commit 7c5026aa9b81dd45df8d3f4e0be73e485976a8b6 ("tg3: Add
    link state reporting to UMP firmware") introduced code that waits for
    previous firmware events to be serviced before attempting to submit a
    new event.  Unfortunately that patch contained a bug that cause the
    driver to wait 2.5 seconds, rather than 2.5 milliseconds as intended.
    This patch fixes that bug.
    
    This bug revealed that not all firmware versions service driver events
    though.  Since we do not know which versions of the firmware do and don't
    service these events, the driver needs some way to minimize the effects
    of the delay.  This patch solves the problem by recording a jiffies
    timestamp when it submits an event to the hardware.  If the jiffies
    counter shows that 2.5 milliseconds have already passed, a wait is not
    needed and the driver can proceed to submit a new event.

    tg3: Add APE register access locking
    
    If the driver resets the chip while the APE is performing a register
    access, that register access will never complete and the APE will hang

    an APE mutex before resetting the chip.  The APE will not attempt a
    register access until it acquires this lock.

    tg3: Fix 'scheduling while atomic' errors
    
    This patch fixes the 'scheduling while atomic' errors introduced by
    commit 12dac0756d357325b107fe6ec24921ec38661839 ("tg3: adapt tg3 to

    The first hunk of the patch removes an unnecessary
    tg3_set_power_state() call.  The chip will already be in the D0 state
    either due to a chip reset or through a previous call to
    tg3_set_power_state().
    
    The second hunk of the patch moves the tg3_set_power_state() call
    outside the critical section guarded by tg3_full_lock() and
    tg3_full_unlock() functions.  The power state of the device is and
    should be outside the lock's domain and all other
    tg3_set_power_state() calls support this.

    tg3: Fix 5761 WOL
    
    On 5761 non-e devices, two problems prevent the administrator from
    overriding the WOL settings in the device's NVRAM.
    
    The first problem is that GPIO 0 and GPIO 2 have been swapped.  This
    change prevented the administrator from turning on WOL when it is
    disabled in NVRAM.  The fix is to add a new path for the 5761 that
    swaps the two GPIOs in the code as well.
    
    The second problem is that GPIO 1 could not be toggled by the driver
    because the GPIO is shared with the debug UART GPIO.  This will prevent
    the administrator from being able to turn WOL off if it was enabled in
    NVRAM.  The fix is to always disable the debug UART after a GRC reset.

    tg3: Fix 5714S / 5715S / 5780S link failures
    
    The git commit ef167e27039eeaea6d3cdd5c547b082e89840bdd entitled
    "Fix supporting flowctrl code" introduced a bug that prevents 5714S,
    5715S and 5780S devices from falling back to a forced link mode.  The
    problem is that the added flow control check will always fail if flow
    control is set to autoneg and either RX or TX (or both) flow control
    is enabled.  The driver defaults to setting flow control to autoneg
    and advertises both RX and TX flow control.
    
    The fix is to remove the errant check.

    tg3: Add link state reporting to UMP firmware
    
    All variants of the 5714, 5715, and 5780 offer a feature called the
    "Universal Management Port".  This feature is implemented in firmware
    and is largely transparent to the driver, except...
    
    It turns out that the UMP firmware needs to know the current status
    of the link.  Because the firmware cannot touch the PHY registers while
    the driver is in control of the device, it needs the driver to report
    link status changes through an additional handshaking mechanism.
    Without this handshake, it has been observed in the field that the UMP
    firmware will not operate correctly.
    
    This patch implements the new handshake with the UMP firmware.  Since
    the handshake uses the same mechanism ASF heartbeats use, code was
    added to detect and wait for completion of a pending previous event.

    tg3: Fix ethtool loopback test for 5761 BX devices
    
    A CPMU related loopback test bug existed for AX revisions of the 5761.
    While that errata has been fixed, the CPMU still slows down the core
    clock too far to run the loopback test successfully.  This patch
    disables the CPMU LINK_SPEED mode just like we do with the AX
    revisions of the 5761 and all revisions of the 5784.

    tg3: Fix 5761 NVRAM sizes
    
    The 5761 NVRAM sizes assigned to the nvram_size member are half as big
    as they should be.  This patch corrects the NVRAM sizes and replaces
    the hardcoded constants with preprocessor constants for readability.

    tg3: Use constant 500KHz MI clock on adapters with a CPMU
    
    The MI clock is not configured correctly on adapters with the CPMU
    present.  The tg3 driver has code which statically sets the MI clock to
    be a fraction of the speed at which the core clock is running.
    However, the CPMU can change the adapter's core clock frequency based
    on operating conditions.  Consequently, the MI will run slow when the
    core's clock has been slowed down.
    
    There is a new 500KHz constant frequency clock available on adapters
    with a CPMU.  This patch removes the static core clock scaling and
    configures the MI clock to use this new 500KHz clock instead.
    
    Running the MI clock at slower speeds will not directly result in data
    corruption, but it does challenge the PHY read and write routine timeouts.

    tg3: 5701 DMA corruption fix
    
    Herbert Xu's commit fb93134dfc2a6e6fbedc7c270a31da03fce88db9, entitled
    "[TCP]: Fix size calculation in sk_stream_alloc_pskb", has triggered a
    bug in the 5701 where the 5701 DMA engine will corrupt outgoing
    packets.  This problem only happens when the starting address of the
    packet matches a certain range of offsets and only when the 5701 is
    placed downstream of a particular Intel bridge.
    
    This patch detects the problematic bridge and if present, readjusts the
    starting address of the packet data to a dword aligned boundary.

    tg3: fix MMIO for PPC 44x platforms
    
    The driver stores the PCI resource addresses into 'unsigned long' variable
    before calling ioremap_nocache() on them. This warrants kernel oops when the
    registers are accessed on PPC 44x platforms which (being 32-bit) have PCI
    memory space mapped beyond 4 GB.
    
    The arch/ppc/ kernel has a fixup in ioremap() that creates an illusion that
    the PCI memory resource is mapped below 4 GB, but arch/powerpc/ code got rid
    of this trick, having instead CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT enabled.

    [TG3]: Fix supporting flowctrl code
    
    This patch does three things.  It modifies tg3_setup_flow_control() to
    use the administrator requested flow control settings if
    autonegotiation is turned off.  It slightly modifies the
    tg3_setup_fiber_mii_phy() function to account for this new use case.
    And finally, it does the same for tg3_setup_copper_phy().
    
    The copper modifications are more than a small multi-line change.  The
    new code makes an attempt to avoid a link renegotiation if the link is
    active at half duplex and the only difference between the current
    advertised settings and requested advertised settings is the
    flow control advertisements.

    [TG3]: Endianness bugfix.
    
    tg3_nvram_write_block_unbuffered() is reading data from nvram into
    allocated buffer before overwriting a part of it with user-supplied
    data.  Then it feeds the entire page back to nvram.  It should be
    storing the words it had read as little-endian, not as host-endian.
    Note that tg3_set_eeprom() does exactly that for padding the same
    data to full words before it gets passed down to tg3_nvram_write_block()
    and then to tg3_nvram_write_block_unbuffered().
    
    Moreover, when we get to sending the entire thing back to nvram, we
    go through it word-by-word, doing essentially
    	writel(swab32(le32_to_cpu(word)), ...)
    so if we want them to reach the card in host-independent endianness,
    we'd better really have all that buffer filled with fixed-endian.
    For user-supplied part we obviously do have that (it's an array of
    octets memcpy'd in), ditto for padding of user-supplied part to word
    boundaries (taken care of in tg3_set_eeprom()).  The rest of the
    buffer gets filled by tg3_nvram_write_block_unbuffered() and it would
    damn better be consistent with that (and with tg3_get_eeprom(), while
    we are at it - there we also convert the words read from nvram to
    little-endian before returning the buffer to user).
    
    The bug should get triggered on big-endian boxen when set_eeprom is done
    for less than entire page.  Then the words that should've been unaffected
    at all will actually get byteswapped in place in nvram.

    At that point the driver is practically endian-clean; the only remaining
    place is an actual bug, AFAICS; will be dealt with in the next patch.

    be disabled after every PHY reset.

    [TG3]: CPMU adjustments for loopback tests
    
    This patch adds the LINK_SPEED mode to the list of CPMU modes that can
    cause the loopback tests to fail.  These bugs are planned to be fixed in
    future revisions of the chip, so the patch qualifies the fixes as such.

    [TG3]: Fix nvram selftest failures
    
    Newer devices contain bootcode in the chip's private ROM area.  This
    bootcode is called selfboot.  Selfboot can be patched in the device's
    NVRAM and the patches can have several formats.  In one particular
    format, the checksum calculation needs to be slightly modified.  This
    patch adjusts the NVRAM test code for that case, and add support for the
    missing formats.

    [TG3]: 5784 / 5764 GPHY power down fix
    
    5784 and 5764 devices fail to link / pass traffic after one load /
    unload cycle.  This happens because of a hardware bug in the new CPMU.
    During normal operation, the MAC depends on the PHY clock being
    available.  When the PHY is powered down, the clock the MAC depends on
    is disabled.  The fix is to switch the MAC clock to an alternate source
    before powering down the PHY, and to restore the MAC clock to the PHY
    source upon device resume.

    [TG3]: Fix 5761 PXEboot crash
    
    When 5761 devices boot the machine using PXEboot, PXE leaves the device
    active when it terminates.  The tg3 driver has code to detect this
    condition and resets the device during initialization.  On 5761 devices,
    device resets involve sending a driver state update message to the APE
    on the 5761.  However, during this initialization stage, communications
    to the APE registers have not yet been set up.  The driver then
    dereferences a NULL pointer and crashes the machine.  The fix is to move
    the APE register access setup earlier in the initialization code to
    cover this condition.

    PCI: Add quirk for devices which disable MSI when INTX_DISABLE is set.
    
    A reasonably common problem with some devices is that they will
    disable MSI generation when the INTX_DISABLE bit is set in the
    PCI_COMMAND register.
    
    Quirk this explicitly, guarding the pci_intx() calls in msi.c with
    this quirk indication.
    
    The first entries for this quirk are for 5714 and 5780 Tigon3 chips,
    and thus we can remove the workaround code from the tg3.c driver.

    [NET]: Fix NAPI completion handling in some drivers.
    
    In order for the list handling in net_rx_action() to be
    correct, drivers must follow certain rules as stated by
    this comment in net_rx_action():
    
    		/* Drivers must not modify the NAPI state if they
    		 * consume the entire weight.  In such cases this code
    		 * still "owns" the NAPI instance and therefore can
    		 * move the instance around on the list at-will.
    		 */
    
    A few drivers do not do this because they mix the budget checks
    with reading hardware state, resulting in crashes like the one
    reported by takano@axe-inc.co.jp.
    
    BNX2 and TG3 are taken care of here, SKY2 fix is from Stephen

        [TG3]: Allow partial speed advertisement.
    
        Honor the advertisement bitmask from ethtool.  We used to always
        advertise the full capability when autoneg was set to on.
    
    changed things around so that ethtool speed settings were strictly
    followed.  Unfortunately ethtool doesn't seem to set ADVERTISED_Autoneg
    in the advertising field (and maybe it shouldn't have to).  I'd vote
    that it should be fixed there, but it should also be added here just in
    case someone using ethtool ioctls in their own application gets what
    they want.
    
    Adding that flag in tg3_set_settings seemed like the most logical place
    since the driver works fine on boot.  This is just an issue when
    re-enabling autonegotiation, so we should probably nip it there.

    [ETHTOOL] Provide default behaviors for a few ethtool sub-ioctls
    
    For the operations
    	get-tx-csum
    	get-sg
    	get-tso
    	get-ufo
    the default ethtool_op_xxx behavior is fine for all drivers, so we
    permit op==NULL to imply the default behavior.
    
    This provides a more uniform behavior across all drivers, eliminating
    ethtool(8) "ioctl not supported" errors on older drivers that had
    not been updated for the latest sub-ioctls.
    
    The ethtool_op_xxx() functions are left exported, in case anyone
    wishes to call them directly from a driver-private implementation --
    a not-uncommon case.  Should an ethtool_op_xxx() helper remain unused
    for a while, except by net/core/ethtool.c, we can un-export it at a
    later date.

    [NET]: Make NAPI polling independent of struct net_device objects.
    
    Several devices have multiple independant RX queues per net
    device, and some have a single interrupt doorbell for several
    queues.
    
    In either case, it's easier to support layouts like that if the
    structure representing the poll is independant from the net
    device itself.
    
    The signature of the ->poll() call back goes from:
    
    	int foo_poll(struct net_device *dev, int *budget)
    
    to
    
    	int foo_poll(struct napi_struct *napi, int budget)
    
    The caller is returned the number of RX packets processed (or
    the number of "NAPI credits" consumed if you want to get
    abstract).  The callee no longer messes around bumping
    dev->quota, *budget, etc. because that is all handled in the
    caller upon return.
    
    The napi_struct is to be embedded in the device driver private data
    structures.
    
    Furthermore, it is the driver's responsibility to disable all NAPI
    instances in it's ->stop() device close handler.  Since the
    napi_struct is privatized into the driver's private data structures,
    only the driver knows how to get at all of the napi_struct instances
    it may have per-device.
    
    With lots of help and suggestions from Rusty Russell, Roland Dreier,
    Michael Chan, Jeff Garzik, and Jamal Hadi Salim.
    
    Bug fixes from Thomas Graf, Roland Dreier, Peter Zijlstra,
    Joseph Fannin, Scott Wood, Hans J. Koch, and Michael Chan.

    [TG3]: Workaround MSI bug on 5714/5780.
    
    A hardware bug was revealed after a recent PCI MSI patch was made to
    always disable legacy INTX when enabling MSI.  The 5714/5780 chips
    will not generate MSI when INTX is disabled, causing MSI failure
    messages to be reported, and another patch was made to workaround the
    problem by disabling MSI on ServerWorks HT1000 bridge chips commonly
    found with the 5714.
    
    We workaround this chip bug by enabling INTX after we enable MSI and
    after we resume from suspend.
    
    Update version to 3.81.
    
    This problem was discovered by David Miller.

    [TG3]: Fix suspend/resume problem.
    
    Joachim Deguara <joachim.deguara@amd.com> reported that tg3 devices
    would not resume properly if the device was shutdown before the system
    was suspended.  In such scenario where the netif_running state is 0,
    tg3_suspend() would not save the PCI state and so the memory enable bit
    and bus master enable bit would be lost.
    
    We fix this by always saving and restoring the PCI state in
    tg3_suspend() and tg3_resume() regardless of netif_running() state.

    [TG3]: Fix msi issue with kexec/kdump.
    
    Tina Yang <tina.yang@oracle.com> discovered an MSI related problem
    when doing kdump.  The problem is that the kexec kernel is booted
    without going through system reset, and as a result, MSI may already
    be enabled when tg3_init_one() is called.  tg3_init_one() calls
    pci_save_state() which will save the stale MSI state.  Later on in
    tg3_open(), we call pci_enable_msi() to reconfigure MSI on the chip
    before we reset the chip.  After chip reset, we call
    pci_restore_state() which will put the stale MSI address/data back
    onto the chip.
    
    This is no longer a problem in the latest kernel because
    pci_restore_state() has been changed to restore MSI state from
    internal data structures which will guarantee restoring the proper
    MSI state.
    
    But I think we should still fix it.  Our save and restore sequence
    can still cause very subtle problems down the road.  The fix is to
    have our own functions save and restore precisely what we need.  We
    also change it to save and restore state inside tg3_chip_reset() in a
    more straight forward way.
    
    Thanks to Tina for helping to test and debug the problem.

    [TG3]: Fix the polarity bit.
    
    For most pre-5705 devices, multiple link interrupts were being generated
    for a single physical link change.  The source of the interrupts was
    determined to be unnecessary toggling of the MAC link polarity bit.
    
    This patch changes the way the link polarity bit gets configured.  Where
    possible, code that dynamically configures the bit in response to link
    changes has been replaced by code that configures the bit once during
    initialization time and then leaves the bit alone.
    
    For correctness, this patch also limits the use of the bit to those
    devices where it is defined, namely devices before the 5705.  This patch
    also corrects the link polarity configurations for 5700 devices when
    paired against a bcm5411 phy.

    [TG3]: Fix irq_sync race condition.
    
    Gagan Arneja <gaagaan@gmail.com> pointed out that tg3_reset_task()
    could potentially race with another thread calling tg3_full_lock()
    such as the ethtool_set_xxx() functions.  This may trigger the
    BUG_ON() in tg3_irq_quiesce() or cause the irq_sync flag to be out-
    of-sync.
    
    I think the easiest way to fix this is to get the tp->lock first
    before setting the irq_sync flag.  This is safe to do because the
    tp->lock is never grabbed by the irq handler.  This change will
    guarantee that the irq_sync flag updates will be serialized.  We also
    have to change one spot to call tg3_netif_start() (which clears the
    irq_sync flag) before releasing the tp->lock.

    PCI: Change all drivers to use pci_device->revision
    
    Instead of all drivers reading pci config space to get the revision
    ID, they can now use the pci_device->revision member.
    
    This exposes some issues where drivers where reading a word or a dword
    for the revision number, and adding useless error-handling around the
    read. Some drivers even just read it for no purpose of all.
    
    In devices where the revision ID is being copied over and used in what
    appears to be the equivalent of hotpath, I have left the copy code
    and the cached copy as not to influence the driver's performance.

    [TG3]: Fix link problem on Dell's onboard 5906.
    
    The bug is caused by code that always set
    (TG3_FLAG_USE_MI_INTERRUPT | TG3_FLAG_USE_LINKCHG_REG) on all Dell's
    onboard devices.  With these 2 flags set, the link status is polled
    by tg3_timer() and will only work when the PHY is set up to interrupt
    the MAC on link changes.  This breaks 5906 because the 5906 PHY does
    not support TG3_FLAG_USE_MI_INTERRUPT the same as other PHYs.
    
    For correctness, only Dell's onboard 5701 needs these 2 flags to be
    set.  This change will fix the 5906 problem and will change other
    Dell devices except 5700 and 5701 to use the more efficient
    interrupt-driven link changes.

    [TG3]: Eliminate spurious interrupts.
    
    Spurious interrupts are often encountered especially on systems
    using the 8259 PIC mode.  This is because the I/O write to deassert
    the interrupt is posted and won't get to the chip immediately.  As
    a result, the IRQ may remain asserted after the IRQ handler exits,
    causing spurious interrupts.
    
    Flush the interrupt mailbox in non-MSI handlers to de-assert the

    [TG3]: Remove reset during MAC address changes.
    
    The reset was added a while back so that ASF could re-init whatever
    MAC address it wanted to use after the MAC address was changed.
    Instead of resetting, we can just keep MAC address 1 unchanged during
    MAC address changes if MAC address 1 is different from MAC address 0.
    
    This fixes 2 problems:
    
    1. Bonding calls set_mac_address in contexts that cannot sleep.
    It no longer sleeps with the chip reset removed.
    
    2. When ASF shares the same MAC address as the NIC, it needs to
    always do that even when the MAC address is changed.

    This patch changes the NVRAM sizing procedure so that the driver can
    take advantage of devices with 1:1 NVRAM strapping configurations.  This
    is useful in cases where the traditional NVRAM sizing method fails.  In

    1. Remove the check for skb->len greater than MTU when doing TSO.
    When the destination has a smaller MSS than the source, a TSO packet
    may be smaller than the MTU and we still need to process it as a TSO
    packet.

    [TG3]: Exit irq handler during chip reset.
    
    On most tg3 chips, the memory enable bit in the PCI command register
    gets cleared during chip reset and must be restored before accessing
    PCI registers using memory cycles.  The chip does not generate
    interrupt during chip reset, but the irq handler can still be called
    because of irq sharing or irqpoll.  Reading a register in the irq
    handler can cause a master abort in this scenario and may result in a
    crash on some architectures.
    
    Use the TG3_FLAG_CHIP_RESETTING flag to tell the irq handler to exit
    without touching any registers.  The checking of the flag is in the
    "slow" path of the irq handler and will not affect normal performance.
    The msi handler is not shared and therefore does not require checking
    the flag.

    /* Do not place this n-ring entries value into the tp struct itself,
      * we really want to expose these constants to GCC so that modulo et
      * al.  operations are done with shifts and masks instead of with

    This fixes a bug reported in:
    
    http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7438
    
    tg3_close() turns off the PHY if WoL and ASF are both disabled.  On
    the next tg3_open(), some devices such as the 5752M will not be
    brought up correctly without a PHY reset early in the reset sequence.
    The PHY clock is needed for some internal MAC blocks to function
    correctly.
    
    This problem is fixed by always resetting the PHY early in
    tg3_reset_hw() when it is called from tg3_open() or tg3_resume().
    tg3_setup_phy() can then be called later in the sequence without the
    reset_phy parameter set to 1, since the PHY reset is already done.

    IRQ: Maintain regs pointer globally rather than passing to IRQ handlers
    
    Maintain a per-CPU global "struct pt_regs *" variable which can be used instead
    of passing regs around manually through all ~1800 interrupt handlers in the
    Linux kernel.
    
    The regs pointer is used in few places, but it potentially costs both stack
    space and code to pass it around.  On the FRV arch, removing the regs parameter
    from all the genirq function results in a 20% speed up of the IRQ exit path
    (ie: from leaving timer_interrupt() to leaving do_IRQ()).
    
    Where appropriate, an arch may override the generic storage facility and do
    something different with the variable.  On FRV, for instance, the address is
    maintained in GR28 at all times inside the kernel as part of general exception
    handling.
    
    Having looked over the code, it appears that the parameter may be handed down
    through up to twenty or so layers of functions.  Consider a USB character
    device attached to a USB hub, attached to a USB controller that posts its
    interrupts through a cascaded auxiliary interrupt controller.  A character
    device driver may want to pass regs to the sysrq handler through the input
    layer which adds another few layers of parameter passing.
    
    I've build this code with allyesconfig for x86_64 and i386.  I've runtested the
    main part of the code on FRV and i386, though I can't test most of the drivers.
    I've also done partial conversion for powerpc and MIPS - these at least compile
    with minimal configurations.
    
    This will affect all archs.  Mostly the changes should be relatively easy.
    Take do_IRQ(), store the regs pointer at the beginning, saving the old one:
    
    	struct pt_regs *old_regs = set_irq_regs(regs);
    
    And put the old one back at the end:
    
    	set_irq_regs(old_regs);
    
    Don't pass regs through to generic_handle_irq() or __do_IRQ().
    
    In timer_interrupt(), this sort of change will be necessary:
    
    	-	update_process_times(user_mode(regs));
    	-	profile_tick(CPU_PROFILING, regs);
    	+	update_process_times(user_mode(get_irq_regs()));
    	+	profile_tick(CPU_PROFILING);
    
    I'd like to move update_process_times()'s use of get_irq_regs() into itself,
    except that i386, alone of the archs, uses something other than user_mode().
    
    Some notes on the interrupt handling in the drivers:
    
     (*) input_dev() is now gone entirely.  The regs pointer is no longer stored in
         the input_dev struct.
    
     (*) finish_unlinks() in drivers/usb/host/ohci-q.c needs checking.  It does
         something different depending on whether it's been supplied with a regs
         pointer or not.
    
     (*) Various IRQ handler function pointers have been moved to type
         irq_handler_t.

    [TG3]: Improve ASF heartbeat.
    
    Change to a different ASF heartbeat message code to improve
    reliability.
    
    There were some reports of unintended resets on real time kernels
    where the timer may be slow and cause the heartbeat to be late.
    Netpoll will also have the same problem because the timer irq will
    be unavailable.
    
    Using the new heartbeat code, the ASF firmware will also check the
    ring condition before resetting the chip when the heartbeat is
    expiring.

    [TG3]: Fix tx race condition
    
    Fix a subtle race condition between tg3_start_xmit() and tg3_tx()
    discovered by Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>:
    
    CPU0					CPU1
    tg3_start_xmit()
    	if (tx_ring_full) {
    		tx_lock
    					tg3_tx()
    						if (!netif_queue_stopped)
    		netif_stop_queue()
    		if (!tx_ring_full)
    						update_tx_ring
    			netif_wake_queue()
    		tx_unlock
    	}
    
    Even though tx_ring is updated before the if statement in tg3_tx() in
    program order, it can be re-ordered by the CPU as shown above.  This
    scenario can cause the tx queue to be stopped forever if tg3_tx() has
    just freed up the entire tx_ring.  The possibility of this happening
    should be very rare though.
    
    The following changes are made:
    
    1. Add memory barrier to fix the above race condition.
    
    2. Eliminate the private tx_lock altogether and rely solely on
    netif_tx_lock.  This eliminates one spinlock in tg3_start_xmit()
    when the ring is full.
    
    3. Because of 2, use netif_tx_lock in tg3_tx() before calling
    netif_wake_queue().
    
    4. Change TX_BUFFS_AVAIL to an inline function with a memory barrier.
    Herbert and David suggested using the memory barrier instead of
    volatile.
    
    5. Check for the full wake queue condition before getting
    netif_tx_lock in tg3_tx().  This reduces the number of unnecessary
    spinlocks when the tx ring is full in a steady-state condition.
    
    6. Update version to 3.65.

    [NET]: Merge TSO/UFO fields in sk_buff
    
    Having separate fields in sk_buff for TSO/UFO (tso_size/ufo_size) is not
    going to scale if we add any more segmentation methods (e.g., DCCP).  So
    let's merge them.
    
    They were used to tell the protocol of a packet.  This function has been
    subsumed by the new gso_type field.  This is essentially a set of netdev
    feature bits (shifted by 16 bits) that are required to process a specific
    skb.  As such it's easy to tell whether a given device can process a GSO
    skb: you just have to and the gso_type field and the netdev's features
    field.
    
    I've made gso_type a conjunction.  The idea is that you have a base type
    (e.g., SKB_GSO_TCPV4) that can be modified further to support new features.
    For example, if we add a hardware TSO type that supports ECN, they would
    declare NETIF_F_TSO | NETIF_F_TSO_ECN.  All TSO packets with CWR set would
    have a gso_type of SKB_GSO_TCPV4 | SKB_GSO_TCPV4_ECN while all other TSO
    packets would be SKB_GSO_TCPV4.  This means that only the CWR packets need
    to be emulated in software.

    [TG3]: Convert to non-LLTX
    
    Herbert Xu pointed out that it is unsafe to call netif_tx_disable()
    from LLTX drivers because it uses dev->xmit_lock to synchronize
    whereas LLTX drivers use private locks.
    
    Convert tg3 to non-LLTX to fix this issue. tg3 is a lockless driver
    where hard_start_xmit and tx completion handling can run concurrently
    under normal conditions. A tx_lock is only needed to prevent
    netif_stop_queue and netif_wake_queue race condtions when the queue
    is full.

    [TG3]: Remove unnecessary tx_lock
    
    Remove tx_lock where it is unnecessary. tg3 runs lockless and so it
    requires interrupts to be disabled and sync'ed, netif_queue and NAPI
    poll to be stopped before the device can be reconfigured. After
    stopping everything, it is no longer necessary to get the tx_lock.

    [TG3]: Add recovery logic when MMIOs are re-ordered
    
    Add recovery logic when we suspect that the system is re-ordering
    MMIOs. Re-ordered MMIOs to the send mailbox can cause bogus tx
    completions and hit BUG_ON() in the tx completion path.
    
    tg3 already has logic to handle re-ordered MMIOs by flushing the MMIOs
    that must be strictly ordered (such as the send mailbox).  Determining
    when to enable the flush is currently a manual process of adding known
    chipsets to a list.
    
    The new code replaces the BUG_ON() in the tx completion path with the
    call to tg3_tx_recover(). It will set the TG3_FLAG_MBOX_WRITE_REORDER
    flag and reset the chip later in the workqueue to recover and start
    flushing MMIOs to the mailbox.
    
    A message to report the problem will be printed. We will then decide
    whether or not to add the host bridge to the list of chipsets that do
    re-ordering.
    
    We may add some additional code later to print the host bridge's ID so
    that the user can report it more easily.
    
    The assumption that re-ordering can only happen on x86 systems is also
    removed.

    [TG3]: Handle Sun onboard tg3 chips more correctly.
    
    Get rid of all the SUN_570X logic and instead:
    
    1) Make sure MEMARB_ENABLE is set when we probe the SRAM
       for config information.  If that is off we will get
       timeouts.
    
    2) Always try to sync with the firmware, if there is no
       firmware running do not treat it as an error and instead
       just report it the first time we notice this condition.
    
    3) If there is no valid SRAM signature, assume the device
       is onboard by setting TG3_FLAG_EEPROM_WRITE_PROT.

    [TG3]: Speed up SRAM access (2nd version)
    
    Speed up SRAM read and write functions if possible by using MMIO
    instead of config. cycles. With this change, the post reset signature
    done at the end of D3 power change must now be moved before the D3
    power change.
    
    IBM reported a problem on powerpc blades during ethtool self test that
    was caused by the memory test taking excessively long. Config.  cycles
    are very slow on powerpc and the memory test can take more than 10
    seconds to complete using config. cycles.
    
    David Miller informed me that an earlier version of the patch caused
    problems on sparc64 systems with built-in tg3 chips. This version
    fixes the problem by excluding all SUN built-in tg3 chips from doing
    MMIO SRAM access.
    
    TG3_FLAG_EEPROM_WRITE_PROT is also set unconditionally when
    TG3_FLG2_SUN_570X is set. This should be sane as all SUN chips are
    built-in and do not require Vaux switching.

    [TG3]: netif_carrier_off runs too early; could still be queued when init fails
    
    Move the netif_carrier_off() call from tg3_init_one()->
    tg3_init_link_config() to tg3_open() as is the convention for most other
    network drivers.
    
    I was getting a panic after a tg3 device failed to initialize due to DMA
    failure.  The oops pointed to the link watch queue with spinlock debugging
    enabled.  Without spinlock debugging, the Oops didn't occur.
    
    I suspect that the link event was getting queued but not executed until
    after the DMA test had failed and the device was freed.  The link event was
    then operating on freed memory, which could contain anything.  With this
    patch applied, the Oops no longer occurs.
    
    [ Based upon feedback from Michael Chan, we move netif_carrier_off()
      to the end of tg3_init_one() instead of moving it to tg3_open() -DaveM ]

    [TG3]: 40-bit DMA workaround part 2
    
    The 40-bit DMA workaround recently implemented for 5714, 5715, and
    5780 needs to be expanded because there may be other tg3 devices
    behind the EPB Express to PCIX bridge in the 5780 class device.
    
    For example, some 4-port card or mother board designs have 5704 behind
    the 5714.
    
    All devices behind the EPB require the 40-bit DMA workaround.

    [TG3]: Add DMA address workaround
    
    Add DMA workaround for chips that do not support full 64-bit DMA
    addresses.
    
    5714, 5715, and 5780 chips only support DMA addresses less than 40
    bits. On 64-bit systems with IOMMU, set the dma_mask to 40-bit so
    that pci_map_xxx() calls will map the DMA address below 40 bits if
    necessary. On 64-bit systems without IOMMU, set the dma_mask to
    64-bit and check for DMA addresses exceeding the limit in
    tg3_start_xmit().
    
    5788 only supports 32-bit DMA so need to set the mask appropriately
    also.
    
    Thanks to Chris Elmquist at SGI for reporting and helping to debug
    the problem on 5714.

    In the close path, calling flush_scheduled_work() may cause deadlock
    if linkwatch_event() is on the workqueue. linkwatch_event() will try
    to get the rtnl_lock() which is already held by tg3_close(). So
    instead, we set a flag in tg3_reset_task() and tg3_close() polls

    power. A new tw32_wait_f() is added for such registers with the
    delay before the read and after the read.

    Change the ASF heart beat to 5 seconds for faster detection of system
    crash. The driver sends the heartbeat every 2 seconds and the ASF

    Fix 5780 PHY related problems:
    
    1. MAC_RX_MODE reset must be done before setting up the MAC_MODE
       register on 5705_PLUS chips or the chip will stop receiving after
       a while. The MAC_RX_MODE reset is needed to prevent intermittently
       losing the first receive packet on serdes chips.
    
    2. Skip MAC loopback test on 5780 because of hardware errata. Normal
       traffic including PHY loopback is not affected by the errata.
    
    3. PHY loopback fails intermittently on 5708S and this is fixed by
       putting the PHY in loopback mode first before programming the MAC
       mode register. A MAC_RX_MODE reset is also added.
    
    4. Return -EINVAL in tg3_nway_reset() if device is in TBI mode. Allow
       nway_reset if 5780S is in parallel detect mode.

    [TG3]: Remove status block access in tg3_msi() and add prefetches
    
    Remove unnecessary status block accesses in tg3_msi(). Since MSI is
    not shared, it is unnecessary to read the status block to determine if
    there are any new events in the MSI handler. It is also unnecessary to
    clear the updated bit in the status block.
    
    Since the poll list is per-cpu, tg3_poll() will be scheduled to run on
    the same CPU that received the MSI. Prefetches for the status block
    and the next rx descriptors are added in tg3_msi() to improve their
    access times when tg3_poll() runs.
    
    In the non-MSI irq handlers, we need to check the status block because
    interrupts may be shared. Only prefetches for the next rx descriptors
    are added.

    [TG3]: Add indirect register method for 5703 behind ICH
    
    This patch adds the new workaround for 5703 A1/A2 if it is behind
    certain ICH bridges. The workaround disables memory and uses config.
    cycles only to access all registers. The 5702/03 chips can mistakenly
    decode the special cycles from the ICH chipsets as memory write cycles,
    causing corruption of register and memory space. Only certain ICH
    bridges will drive special cycles with non-zero data during the address
    phase which can fall within the 5703's address range. This is not an ICH
    bug as the PCI spec allows non-zero address during special cycles.
    However, only these ICH bridges are known to drive non-zero addresses
    during special cycles.
    
    The indirect_lock is also changed to spin_lock_irqsave from spin_lock_bh
    because it is used in irq handler when using the indirect method to
    disable interrupts.

    [TG3]: Add various register methods
    
    This patch adds various dedicated register read/write methods for the
    existing workarounds, including PCIX target workaround, write with read
    flush, etc. The chips that require these workarounds will use these
    dedicated access functions.

    [TG3]: Add basic register access function pointers
    
    This patch adds the basic function pointers to do register accesses in
    the fast path. This was suggested by David Miller. The idea is that
    various register access methods for different hardware errata can easily
    be implemented with these function pointers and performance will not be
    degraded on chips that use normal register access methods.
    
    The various register read write macros (e.g. tw32, tr32, tw32_mailbox)
    are redefined to call the function pointers.

    [TG3]: Fix ethtool loopback test lockup
    
    The tg3_abort_hw() call in tg3_test_loopback() is causing lockups on
    some devices. tg3_abort_hw() disables the memory arbiter, causing
    tg3_reset_hw() to hang when it tries to write the pre-reset signature.
    tg3_abort_hw() should only be called after the pre-reset signature has
    been written. This is all done in tg3_reset_hw() so the tg3_abort_hw()
    call is unnecessary and can be removed.

    [TG3]: Fix SerDes detection
    
    A problem was reported by Grant Grundler on an HP rx8620 using IOX
    Core LAN partno(A7109-6) 5701 copper NIC. The tg3 driver mistakenly
    detects this NIC as having a SerDes PHY and link does not come up as a
    result.
    
    The problem was caused by an incorrectly programmed eeprom that set the
    NIC_SRAM_DATA_CFG_PHY_TYPE_FIBER bit in the NIC_SRAM_DATA_CFG location.
    
    This patch will override the NIC_SRAM_DATA_CFG_PHY_TYPE_FIBER bit if a
    valid PHY ID is read from the MII registers on older 570x chips where
    the MII interface is not used on SerDes chips. On newer chips such as
    the 5780 that use MII for both copper and SerDes, SerDes detection must
    rely on the eeprom.
    
    This patch will make the SerDes detection identical to versions 3.25 and
    older.

    [TG3]: Refinements to new locking strategy.
    
    1. Move tp->irq_sync = 0 to before the interrupt mailbox IO in
       tg3_enable_ints() so that the interrupt handler will always see
       irq_sync == 0 when interrupts are enabled.
    
    2. Remove the tg3_enable_ints() call in tg3_reset_hw(). Interrupts are
       always enabled explicitly or through tg3_netif_start(). This is to
       prevent interrupts being enabled while poll is disabled.
    
    3. Update trans_start with jiffies in tg3_netif_stop() to prevent false
       NETDEV WATCHDOG.
    
    4. Pass in the proper irq_sync parameter to tg3_full_lock() depending on
       netif_running() in some of the ethtool set calls.

    [TG3]: Eliminate all hw IRQ handler spinlocks.
    
    Move all driver spinlocks to be taken at sw IRQ
    context only.
    
    This fixes the skb_copy() we were doing with hw
    IRQs disabled (which is illegal and triggers a
    BUG() with HIGHMEM enabled).  It also simplifies
    the locking all over the driver tremendously.
    
    We accomplish this feat by creating a special
    sequence to synchronize with the hw IRQ handler
    using a binary state and synchronize_irq().
    This idea is from Herbert Xu.

    [TG3] Fix link failure in 5701
    
    On some 5701 devices with older bootcode, the LED configuration bits in
    SRAM may be invalid with value zero. The fix is to check for invalid

    error in programming the PHY.
    
    Thanks to Grant Grundler for debugging the problem.
    
    >From Grant:
    | In May, 2004,  tg3 v3.4 changed how MAC_LED_CTRL (0x40c) was getting
    | programmed and how to determine what to program into LED_CTRL. The new
    | code trusted NIC_SRAM_DATA_CFG (0x00000b58) to indicate what to write
    | to LED_CTRL and MII EXT_CTRL registers. On "IOX Core Lan", SRAM was
    | saying MODE_MAC (0x0) and that doesn't work.

    [TG3]: Set minimal hw interrupt mitigation.
    
    Even though we do software interrupt mitigation
    via NAPI, it still helps to have some minimal
    hw assisted mitigation.
    
    This helps, particularly, on systems where register
    I/O overhead is much greater than the CPU horsepower.
    
    For example, it helps on NUMA systems.  In such cases
    the PIO overhead to disable interrupts for NAPI accounts
    for the majority of the packet processing cost.  The
    CPU is fast enough such that only a single packet is
    processed by each NAPI poll call.
    
    Thanks to Michael Chan for reviewing this patch.

    [TG3]: Add tagged status support.
    
    When supported, use the TAGGED interrupt processing support
    the chip provides.  In this mode, instead of a "on/off" binary
    semaphore, an incrementing tag scheme is used to ACK interrupts.
    
    All MSI supporting chips support TAGGED mode, so the tg3_msi()
    interrupt handler uses it unconditionally.  This invariant is
    verified when MSI support is tested.
    
    Since we can invoke tg3_poll() multiple times per interrupt under
    high packet load, we fetch a new copy of the tag value in the
    status block right before we actually do the work.
    
    Also, because the tagged status tells the chip exactly which
    work we have processed, we can make two optimizations:
    
    1) tg3_restart_ints() need not check tg3_has_work()
    2) the tg3_timer() need not poke the chip 10 times per
       second to keep from losing interrupt events
    
    Based upon valuable feedback from Michael Chan <mchan@broadcom.com>

    [TG3]: Fix tg3_restart_ints()
    
    tg3_restart_ints() is called to re-enable interrupts after tg3_poll()
    has finished all the work. It calls tg3_cond_int() to force an interrupt
    if the status block updated bit is set. The updated bit will be set if
    there is a new status block update sometime during tg3_poll() and it can
    be very often. The worst part is that even if all the work has been
    processed, the updated bit remains set and an interrupt will be forced
    unnecessarily.
    
    The fix is to call tg3_has_work() instead to determine if new work is
    posted before forcing an interrupt. The way to force an interrupt is
    also changed to use "coalesce_now" instead of "SETINT". The former is
    generally a safer way to force the interrupt.
    
    Also deleted the first parameter to tg3_has_work() which is unused.

    [TG3]: Fix bug in tg3_rx()
    
    This patch fixes a bug that causes tg3_has_work() to always return 1.
    
    rx work is determined by comparing tp->rx_rcb_ptr with the current hw
    producer index. The hw producer index is modulo the ring size, but tp-
    >rx_rcb_ptr is a free running counter that goes up beyond the ring size.
    After the ring wraps around once, tg3_has_work() will always return 1.
    
    The fix is to always do modulo arithmetic on tp->rx_rcb_ptr.
