CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_YES
  Repeatedly outputs a line with all specified string(s), or 'y'.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_BUFFERS_GO_ON_STACK
  BusyBox will, by default, malloc space for its buffers.  This costs code
  size for the call to xmalloc.  You can use the following feature to have
  them put on the stack.  For some very small machines with limited stack
  space, this can be deadly.  For most folks, this works just fine...

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_BUFFERS_GO_IN_BSS
  The third alternative for buffer allocation is to use BSS.  This works
  beautifully for computers with a real MMU (and OS support), but wastes
  runtime RAM for uCLinux.  This behavior was the only one available for
  BusyBox versions 0.48 and earlier.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_USE_DEVPS_PATCH
  Turn this on to use Erik's very cool devps, and devmtab kernel drivers,
  thereby eliminating the need for the /proc filesystem and thereby saving
  lots and lots memory for more important things.  NOTE:  If you enable this
  feature, you _must_ have patched the kernel to include the devps patch that
  is included in the busybox/kernel-patches directory.  You will also need to
  create some device special files in /dev on your embedded system:
         mknod /dev/mtab c 10 22
         mknod /dev/ps c 10 21
  I emailed Linus and this patch will not be going into the stock kernel.

  Allow the shell to invoke all the compiled in BusyBox applets as if they
  were shell builtins.  Nice for staticly linking an emergency rescue shell,
  among other things.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_SH_APPLETS_ALWAYS_WIN
  When this is enabled, busybox shell applets can be called using full path
  names.  This causes applets (i.e., most busybox commands) to override
  real commands on the filesystem.  For example, if you run run /bin/cat, it
  will use BusyBox cat even if /bin/cat exists on the filesystem and is _not_
  busybox.  Some systems want this, others do not.  Choose wisely.  :-)

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_SH_FANCY_PROMPT
  Some deeply embedded systems don't have usernames or even hostnames,
  and the fancy prompt can look rather hideous on them. Enable this option
  for a fancy prompt.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_FBSET_FANCY
  Turn on extra fbset options.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_FBSET_READMODE
  Turn on fbset readmode support.

  user's have logged into and logged out of the system, allowing programs
  such as 'who' and 'last' to list who is currently logged in.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_CLEAN_UP
  Clean up all memory before exiting -- usually not needed
  as the OS can clean up...  Don't enable this unless you
  have a really good reason for cleaning things up manually.

  may only change the password for his/her own account, the super user
  may change the password for any account.  The administrator of a group
  may change the password for the group.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_SU
  su is used to become another user during a login session.
  Invoked without a username, su defaults to becoming the super user.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_SULOGIN
  sulogin is invoked when the system goes into single user
  mode (this is done through an entry in inittab).

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_USE_BB_PWD_GRP
  If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's password
  and group functions.  And if you are using the GNU C library
  (glibc), you will then need to install the /etc/nsswitch.conf
  configuration file and the required /lib/libnss_* libraries in
  order for the password and group functions to work.  This generally
  makes your embedded system quite a bit larger.

  Enabling this option will cause busybox to directly access the
  system's /etc/password, /etc/group files (and your system will be
  smaller, and I will get fewer emails asking about how glibc NSS
  works).  When this option is enabled, you will not be able to use
  PAM to access remote LDAP password servers and whatnot.  And if you
  want hostname resolution to work with glibc, you still need the
  /lib/libnss_* libraries.

  If you enable this option, it will add about 1.5k to busybox.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_USE_BB_SHADOW
  If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's shadow
  password handling functions.  And if you are using the GNU C library
  (glibc), you will then need to install the /etc/nsswitch.conf
  configuration file and the required /lib/libnss_* libraries in
  order for the shadow password functions to work.  This generally
  makes your embedded system quite a bit larger.

  Enabling this option will cause busybox to directly access the
  system's /etc/shadow file when handling shadow passwords.  This
  makes your system smaller and I will get fewer emails asking about
  how glibc NSS works).  When this option is enabled, you will not be
  able to use PAM to access shadow passwords from remote LDAP
  password servers and whatnot.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_VLOCK
  Build the "vlock" applet which allows you to lock (virtual) terminals.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_INITRD
  Allow init to be called from an initrd as linuxrc.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_MESG
  Mesg controls access to your terminal by others.  It is typically
  used to allow or disallow other users to write to your terminal

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_FDFORMAT
  fdformat is used to low-level format a floppy disk.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_FDISK
  The fdisk utility is used to divide hard disks into one or more
  logical disks, which are generally called partitions.  This utility
  can be used to list and edit the set of partitions or BSD style
  'disk slices' that are defined on a hard drive.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_AIX_LABEL
  Enabling this option allows you to create or change AIX disklabels.
  Most people can safely leave this option disabled.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_FDISK_ADVANCED
  Enabling this option allows you to do terribly unsafe things like
  define arbitrary drive geometry, move the beginning of data in a
  partition, and similarly evil things.  Unless you have a very good
  reason you would be wise to leave this disabled.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_FDISK_WRITABLE
  Enabling this option allows you to create or change a partition table
  and write those changes out to disk.  If you leave this option
  disabled, you will only be able to view the partition table.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_HWCLOCK_LONGOPTIONS
  By default, the hwclock utility only uses short options.  If you
  are overly fond of its long options, such as --hctosys, --utc, etc)
  then enable this option.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_OSF_LABEL
  Enabling this option allows you to create or change BSD disklabels
  and define and edit BSD disk slices.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_SGI_LABEL
  Enabling this option allows you to create or change SGI disklabels.
  Most people can safely leave this option disabled.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_SUN_LABEL
  Enabling this option allows you to create or change SUN disklabels.
  Most people can safely leave this option disabled.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_HEXDUMP
  The hexdump utility is used to display binary data in a readable
  way that is comparable to the output from most hex editors.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_HWCLOCK
  The hwclock utility is used to read and set the hardware clock
  on a system.  This is primarily used to set the current time on
  shutdown in the hardware clock, so the hardware will keep the
  correct time when Linux is _not_ running.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_FDISK_SUPPORT_LARGE_DISKS
  Enable this option to support large disks > 4GB.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_CROND
  Crond is a background daemon that parses individual crontab
  files and executes commands on behalf of the users in question.
  This is a port of dcron from slackware.  It uses files of the
  format /var/spool/cron/crontabs/<username> files, for example:
      $ cat /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root
      # Run daily cron jobs at 4:40 every day:
      40 4 * * * /etc/cron/daily > /dev/null 2>&1

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_CRONTAB
  Crontab manipulates the crontab for a particular user.  Only
  the superuser may specify a different user and/or crontab directory.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_DEVFSD
  Provides compatibility with old device names on a devfs systems.
  You should set it to true if you have devfs enabled.
  The following keywords in devsfd.conf are supported:
  "CLEAR_CONFIG", "INCLUDE", "OPTIONAL_INCLUDE", "RESTORE",
  "PERMISSIONS", "EXECUTE", "COPY", "IGNORE",
  "MKOLDCOMPAT", "MKNEWCOMPAT","RMOLDCOMPAT", "RMNEWCOMPAT".

  But only if they are written UPPERCASE!!!!!!!!

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_DEVFSD_FG_NP
  -fg	Run the daemon in the foreground.
  -np	Exit  after  parsing  the configuration file. Do not poll for events.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_DEVFSD_MODLOAD
  This actually doesn't work with busybox  modutils but needs the real modutils.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_DEVFSD_VERBOSE
  Increases logging to stderr or syslog.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_CROND_CALL_SENDMAIL
  Support calling /usr/sbin/sendmail for send cmd outputs.

  You can reset the generator by using a specified start value.
  After "unset RANDOM" then generator will switch off and this
  variable will no longer have special treatment.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_COMMAND_SAVEHISTORY
  Enable history saving in ash shell.

  Awk is used as a pattern scanning and processing language.  This is
  the BusyBox implementation of that programming language.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_AWK_MATH
  Enable math functions of the Awk programming language.
  NOTE: This will require libm to be present for linking.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_VI_OPTIMIZE_CURSOR
  This will make the cursor movement faster, but requires more memory
  and it makes the applet a tiny bit larger.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_PATCH
  Apply a unified diff formatted patch.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_FIND_INUM
  Support the 'find -inum' option for searching by inode number.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_FIND_XDEV
  This option will allow find to restrict searches to a single
  filesystem.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_GREP_FGREP_ALIAS
          fgrep sees the search pattern as a normal string rather than
  regular expressions.
  grep -f is always builtin, this just creates the fgrep alias.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_XARGS_SUPPORT_CONFIRMATION
  Support prompt the user about whether to run each command
  line and read a line from the terminal.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_XARGS_SUPPORT_QUOTES
  Default xargs unsupport single and double quotes
  and backslash for can use aruments with spaces.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_XARGS_SUPPORT_TERMOPT
  Enable support exit if the size (see the -s or -n option)
  is exceeded.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_XARGS_SUPPORT_ZERO_TERM
  Enable input filenames are terminated by a null character
  instead of by whitespace, and the quotes and backslash
  are not special.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_CHECK_TAINTED_MODULE
  Support checking for tainted modules.  These are usually binary
  only modules that will make the linux-kernel list ignore your
  support request.
  This option is required to support GPLONLY modules.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_INSMOD_KSYMOOPS_SYMBOLS
  By adding module symbols to the kernel symbol table, Oops messages
  occuring within kernel modules can be properly debugged.  By enabling
  this feature, module symbols will always be added to the kernel symbol
  table for properly debugging support.  If you are not interested in
  Oops messages from kernel modules, say N.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_INSMOD_LOAD_MAP
  Enabling this, one would be able to get a load map
  output on stdout. This makes kernel module debugging
  easier.
  If you don't plan to debug kernel modules, you
  don't need this option.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_INSMOD_LOAD_MAP_FULL
  Without this option, -m will only output section
  load map.  With this option, -m will also output
  symbols load map.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_DMALLOC
  N/A

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_EFENCE
  N/A

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_BUFFERS_USE_MALLOC
  N/A

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_DEVFS
  Enable if you want BusyBox to work with devfs.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_DEVPTS
  Enable if you want BusyBox to use Unix98 PTY support. If enabled,
  busybox will use /dev/ptmx for the master side of the pseudoterminal
  and /dev/pts/<number> for the slave side.  Otherwise, BSD style
  /dev/ttyp<number> will be used. To use this option, you should have
  devpts or devfs mounted.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_SUID
  Support SUID and SGID binaries.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_SUID_CONFIG
  Allow the SUID / SGID state of an applet to be determined runtime by
  checking /etc/busybox.conf.  The format of this file is as follows:

  <applet> = [Ssx-][Ssx-][x-] (<username>|<uid>).(<groupname>|<gid>)

  An example might help:

  [SUID]
  su = ssx root.0 # applet su can be run by anyone and runs with euid=0/egid=0
  su = ssx        # exactly the same

  mount = sx- root.disk # applet mount can be run by root and members of group disk
                        # and runs with euid=0

  cp = --- # disable applet cp for everyone

  Robert 'sandman' Griebl has more information here:
  <url: http://www.softforge.de/bb/suid.html >.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_SUID_CONFIG_QUIET
  /etc/busybox.conf should be readable by the user needing the SUID, check
  this option to avoid users to be notified about missing permissions.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_LFS
  If you want to build BusyBox with large file support, then enable
  this option.  This will have no effect if your kernel or your C
  library lacks large file support for large files.  Some of the
  programs that can benefit from large file support include dd, gzip,
  cp, mount, tar, and many others.  If you want to access files larger
  than 2 Gigabytes, enable this option.  Otherwise, leave it set to 'N'.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_SELINUX
  Enable support for SE Linux in applets ls, ps, and id.  Also provide
  the option of compiling in SE Linux applets.

  If you do not have a complete SE Linux Full Userland installed, this
  stuff will not compile.  Go visit
	http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/index.html
  to download the necessary stuff to allow busybox to compile with this
  option enabled.

  Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_STATIC
  If you want to build a static BusyBox binary, which does not
  use or require any shared libraries, then enable this option.
  This can cause BusyBox to be considerably larger, so you should
  leave this option false unless you have a good reason (i.e.
  your target platform does not support shared libraries, or
  you are building an initrd which doesn't need anything but
  BusyBox, etc).

  Most people will leave this set to 'N'.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_BUNZIP2
  bunzip2 is a compression utility using the Burrows-Wheeler block
  sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression
  is generally considerably better than that achieved by more
  conventional LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the
  performance of the PPM family of statistical compressors.

  The BusyBox bunzip2 applet is limited to de-compression only.
  On an x86 system, this applet adds about 11K.

  Unless you have a specific application which requires bunzip2, you
  should probably say N here.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_DEB_TAR_BZ2
  This allows dpkg and dpkg-deb to extract deb's that are compressed internally
  with bzip2 instead of gzip.

  You only want this if you are creating your own custom debian packages that
  use an internal control.tar.bz2 or data.tar.bz2.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_DEB_TAR_GZ
  This is the default compression method inside the debian ar file.

  If you want compatibility with standard .deb's you should say yes here.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_DPKG_DEB_EXTRACT_ONLY
  This reduces dpkg-deb to the equivalent of "ar -p <deb> data.tar.gz | tar -zx".
  However it saves space as none of the extra dpkg-deb, ar or tar options are
  needed, they are linked to internally.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_GUNZIP_UNCOMPRESS
  Enable if you want gunzip to have the ability to decompress
  archives created by the program compress (not much
  used anymore).

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_TAR_BZIP2
  If you enable this option you'll be able to extract
  archives compressed with bzip2.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_TAR_COMPRESS
  If you enable this option tar will be able to call uncompress,
  when extracting .tar.Z archives.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_TAR_FROM
  If you enable this option you'll be able to specify
  a list of files to include or exclude from an archive.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_TAR_GNU_EXTENSIONS
  With this option busybox supports GNU long filenames and
  linknames.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_TAR_LONG_OPTIONS
  Enable use of long options, increases size by about 400 Bytes

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_TAR_OLDGNU_COMPATABILITY
  This option is required to unpack archives created in
  the old GNU format; help to kill this old format by
  repacking your ancient archives with the new format.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_UNARCHIVE_TAPE
  I don't think this is needed anymore.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_UNCOMPRESS
  uncompress is used to decompress archives created by compress.
  Not much used anymore, replaced by gzip/gunzip.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_SYSCTL

  side effects on syslog because of the semaphore.
  This option make logread to double buffer copy
  from circular buffer, minimizing semaphore
  contention at some minor memory expense.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_DUMPLEASES
  dumpleases displays the leases written out by the udhcpd server.
  Lease times are stored in the file by time remaining in lease, or
  by the absolute time that it expires in seconds from epoch.

  See http://udhcp.busybox.net for further details.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_UDHCP_DEBUG
  If selected, udhcpd will output extra debugging output.  If using
  this option, compile uDHCP with "-g", and do not fork the daemon to
  the background.

  See http://udhcp.busybox.net for further details.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_UDHCP_SYSLOG
  If selected, udhcpd will log all its messages to syslog, otherwise,
  it will attempt to log them to stdout.

  See http://udhcp.busybox.net for further details.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_UDHCPC
  uDHCPc is a DHCP client geared primarily toward embedded systems,
  while striving to be fully functional and RFC compliant.

  strings for display of the browser.  Output goes to stdout.
  For example, httpd -e "<Hello World>" as
  "&#60Hello&#32World&#62".

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_HTTPD_RELOAD_CONFIG_SIGHUP
  This option enables processing of SIGHUP to reload cached
  configuration settings.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_HTTPD_SETUID
  This option allows the server to run as a specific user
  rather than defaulting to the user that starts the server.
  Use of this option requires special privileges to change to a
  different user.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_HTTPD_SET_REMOTE_PORT_TO_ENV
  Use of this option can assist scripts in generating
  references that contain a unique port number.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_HTTPD_USAGE_FROM_INETD_ONLY
  This option disables uid and port options for the httpd applet
  but requires inetd server daemon.

  able to work with IPv6.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_TELNETD_INETD
  Selecting this will make telnetd only callable from inetd,
  removing the standalone support.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_TELNET_AUTOLOGIN
  Setting this option will forward the USER environment variable to the
  remote host you are connecting to. This is useful when you need to
  log into a machine without telling the username (autologin). This
  option enables `-a' and `-l USER' arguments.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_TFTP_BLOCKSIZE
  Allow the client to specify the desired block size for transfers.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_TFTP_DEBUG
  Enable debug settings for tftp.  This is useful if you're running
  into problems with tftp as the protocol doesn't help you much when
  you run into problems.

CONFIG_USER_BUSYBOX_IFUPDOWN
  Activate or deactivate the specified interfaces.  This applet makes
  use of either "ifconfig" and "route" or the "ip" command to actually
  configure network interfaces.  Therefore, you will probably also want
  to enable either CONFIG_IFCONFIG and CONFIG_ROUTE, or enable
  CONFIG_FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_IP and the various CONFIG_IP options.  Of
  course you could use non-busybox versions of these programs, so
  against my better judgement (since this will surely result in plenty
  of support questions on the mailing list), I do not force you to
  enable these additional options.  It is up to you to supply either
  "ifconfig" and "route" or the "ip" command, either via busybox or via
  standalone utilities.
